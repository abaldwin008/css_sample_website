or maybe I will not.

In any case, this like all the other posts at this venture is merrily a test while I am learning the art of tinkering and making this blog happen. :-)

That being said, I actually do plan to have my very own Jekyll blog so I'm actually writing the post. The brilliance of having a static site is there is nothing to hack, but that also means there's a process to adding comments. It's an exercise to add some comments to this blog in the Learn Enough CSS and Layout to be dangerous, and I plan to use disques to solve the problem. I haven't done that atm, however, as I plan to save it for the clean-up and polishing portion of the project at the end.
